.. _Installing and Configuring the F5 AST:

Module 2: Installing, Configuring, Updating, and Accessing the F5 AST
=====================================================================

Prepare yourself -- the time is now for us to review and delve into the installation and configuration of F5's Application Study Tool!

As you will soon find out, this tool is designed to deliver value with high velocity.

.. attention:: We're not trying to get in the way of your productivity, so as you can see, there's not a ton of fluff or complexity in this module -- it consists of three lab exercises.

   Our goal is to provide students with the options of running through a full, clean installation of the F5 AST within the UDF environment and/or learning about and interacting with a pre-installed copy of F5 AST.
   
   At the end of **Lab 1 - Accessing and Using the GitHub Repository**, you'll be presented with both options and can then choose your desired path.

Please select **Next** below and carry on to :ref:`Accessing and Using the GitHub Repository`
