.. _Exploring the F5 LADT:

Module 4: Exploring the F5 Local API Discovery Tool
===================================================

Here we'll provide a sneak peak at an extension of the **F5 AST** called the **F5 Local API Discovery Tool (LADT)**. The **F5 LADT** is a new development which students can explore in the UDF lab environment. If customers would like to get their hands on the F5 LADT, they should reach out to their account team for more details, as the repo is not yet publicly available.

.. note:: At the time of this lab module's publication, the UDF lab environment is not geared toward students performing installation and configuration.
    
    We will be amending the lab in order to mimick that of the F5 AST portions; allowing students to either interact with a pre-installed copy and/or run through the process of installing it themselves.



Please select **Next** and proceed to the :ref:`LADT - Overview`.
